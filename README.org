A [[https://nixos.org/nix/][nix]] derivation for the [[https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/][NCAR Command Language]] (NCL).

* Caveats
  - On Darwin systems (i.e. macOS), I haven't had any success running *any* of
    the graphical NCAR Computer Graphics Metafile (NCGM) display tools
    (e.g. =idt=, =ictrans=, and =ctrans -d X11=). The NCAR Graphics libs seem to
    work ok though (based on linking against them in [[https://github.com/tviti/ROMS-plot.nix][ROMS-plot.nix]]).
  - On nixOS, I haven't had any success running any of the *interactive*
    graphical NCGM display tools (e.g. =idt= and =ictrans=). My workaround at
    the moment is to either use =ctrans -d X11=, or to just dump the NCGM to an
    hdf file (e.g. ~ctrans -d hdf ./gmeta.ncgm > ./gmeta.hdf~).
